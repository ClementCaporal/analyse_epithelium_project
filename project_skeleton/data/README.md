# Data ReadMe

You should include in this readme everything that is necessary to understand the data.
When possible, this should follow the **FAIR principles** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/

Your code shouldn't erase, modify or move the `data` folder. It should only write new data in the `results` folder.

Thus current data in the `cells` and `leaf` folders are provided as an example. You can use them to test your code but you should build your own database as described in the project `README.md`.
